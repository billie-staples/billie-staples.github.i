       Three things I learnt about myself, on a deeper level,  the ability of negative sensitivity, a tendency to overcomplicate and that I have lots of work to do, the work is never done . 
        I thought multiple times throughout the core learning, “I can be a sensitive freaker outer over complicate it till you break it being”.  The unlearning I have to do to better who I am as a person is right there for me, throughout this material. Learning has such a big effect on who you are as a person and ego. It has really brought to light the negative thought places I can go. At the same time I feel I have  gained a deeper understanding of how to work against that. 
        Values, empathy and self-awareness are really solid foundations to have in order to learn the tech material. Of course not all programmers have all these attributes yet but being able to grow these seems essential in longevity of career. For me It feels like you the programmer are bringing the heart or soul to the code, you write what choices or actions you want to create. Even when you are following instructions or have limitations within what you can write, there are lots of choices over how you can write said code.

        A big surprise, about the core learning,  has been identifying deeper into my motivations for wanting to become a developer. How deeply valuable it has been, in turn allowed me to learn about myself. I haven’t had the ability to reflect, so often and in a setting, where it is within an intense learning environment(even if it is remote). I was surprised by just how generally challenged I felt during the core learning. 
        The most challenging parts of the core work for me were the learning plans, I found it difficult to think long term alongside the intense application of a lot of Tech learning. 
        But I will say the challenging aspects are all actually positive lessons. Although it was challenging to answer future goal questions, it is really important to think about that. A particularly challenging aspect of the core learning was coming up against the ego when reflecting throughout the process.
        
        In my opinion, so much time is focused on the core learning because you want to give your students a whole approach to learning. There is empathy around how much technically there is to learn so the core supports the student to get through that, especially a novice like me. I also think that you are a fabulously holistic EDA and you want to give a fully considered approach to learning. Understanding how humans work, our brains, our emotions helps us in distinguishing how much we can control and inform. The core is challenging, more so empowering work. Core learning is so very valuable and necessary. For the more tech savvy students I think it is valuable to take the time to reflect, whether you are able to truly appreciate it in the moment. Reflecting can be quite challenging as it asks you to think about things you may not have seen before. 
        
        “Core, mate! You are not a waste of time at all!!”
        
  
        "What surprised me the most about learning core is...
        
        …how much I genuinely learnt about myself, through the explorations and reflection. Learning Core made me recognise, more than ever, how much unlearning I had / have to do. I was surprised at how engaged I was in the core material. I think it is a very well devised offering, in its entirety.”
