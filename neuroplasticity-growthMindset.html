    “A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. 
    You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, 
    but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams 
    and you will always look lovely.” Roald Dahl

  Neuroplasticity is fundamentally our brains ability to adapt in response to experiences and throughout life, the brain modifies its structure and function. 
  The brain can grow new pathways. There are different ways we can use more of our brains and use them in positive ways. 
  Through exercise, diet and environment we can help ourselves to build good patterns of behaviour. 
  People learn in many different ways, for different amounts of time, with different specificities. 
  By understanding neuroplasticity it can help us to know what works best for us as learners. 
  What the science of neuroplasticity basically shows is that brains can change.

    Learning is an incredible opportunity for anyone. 
    Humans should all be able to have the potential to learn any kind of skill or subject. 
    When you have time and practice we are able to learn any manner of content. 
    Neuroplasitcy and growth mindset work together hand in hand, to develop humans' depth of knowledge. 
    These ideas are also universal human truth concepts that any person, from anywhere can understand and connect with. 
    I wish we talked about neuroplasticity more.  
    I wish we actively supported each other, our communities and ourselves more, in learning new skills, with time, care and longevity.

  During week three of foundations part of this developer programme, I felt truly tested. 
  There was a moment during the beginning of learning about Javascript I questioned if I was even smart enough to grasp the concepts. 
  That was my fixed mindset talking, telling me I would not be able to learn it. 
  On top of having support, having a growth mindset in learning is key to being a student and developer. 
  I am still rewiring my brain if you will, parts of my brain to use logic patterns and numbers as natural. 
  It is an incredible albeit hard process. Without a growth mindset, I wouldn't be able to learn Javascript or any other programming language.
