      DOM meaning: Document Object Model
      CSS meaning: Cascading Style Sheets
      HTML meaning: Hyper Text Markup Language

    <p> One way to think about these “scary” looking acronyms - programming languages- interfaces is like a face or a human head. The HTML is the body part/ the feature, for example the nose or eyes. 
        CSS is, for example,  a brown eye color or an oval face shape. 
        Javascript is the brown eyes blinking or the head nodding.

      Control flow is the order in which the functions, conditionals, and code input takes place. We can imagine we are in Auckland Town halls concert chamber,  control flow is our conductor, the different musicians/ instruments make sounds/ create action and the timing/ flow of this is important, to the ultimate song or output. 
      Loops are a crucial part of programming. 
      One can think of a loop as how many times does the pianist, fingers touch the keys, when the loop stops, the song has ended.

      The key difference between an Object and an array, is that an object is a topic or type of and an array is a list of things. 
      To access information in an array, we can use zero based indexing, where counting in coding, starts from 0. 
      This is different to an Object where there are two kinds of ways to dissect information; Square bracket notation and dot notation.

      Functions are a key building block of coding. They are a series of actions, set out in a formula to create an output or an answer. 
      Almost like a calculator, if you will, but the output can be more than just mathematical, in terms of what data the function can format. 
      Functions are extremely valuable because they can be used (and reused) multiple times, to output arrays, loops etc. 
      Ultimately and plainly; functions are a set of steps that perform an outcome.

      The Document Object Model is made up of essentially nodes. In order to access different parts of a Webpage through the DOM, i.e elements, you can access these by their tag whether that be a div, p, img/ id or class, or a combination of the above. 
      The DOM is an interface that understands programming language and allows programmers to work more efficiently. 
      HTML, as the bones of a webpage. HTML works with the DOM to present the page so that the bones, structure and content can be made, added to and checked. 
      As the styling of the page is CSS, the DOM also seamlessly interacts with CSS so that it can be used to test, trial and create.
      A key function of the DOM is its ability to check that the code is working, by console logging your results, which can be accessed through a web browser, through the Developer tools in Chrome.
