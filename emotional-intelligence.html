   Emotional meaning: (of a person) having feelings that are easily excited and openly displayed.
   Intelligent meaning: having or showing intelligence, especially of a high level.
   Quotient meaning: a degree or amount of a specified quality or characteristic.

  Emotional Quotient is our ability to recognise and understand emotions in other people. (I believe as well as animals, nature and the cosmos). 
  Intelligence Quotient is used to measure our ability to problem solve, use logic and understand complex ideas. 
  EQ is importantly an individual's ability to recognise and interpret these emotions, in doing so guides how they interact with others, and broader, the world.

  How do I place myself in the universe, you ask?
  I see Emotional and Intelligence quotients pulled apart independently by our colonialist "mamas and papas" thus vastly informing, more so defining the cold metal structures that have made what our world (western and developing) are. 
  We have built styrofoam podiums, mantels from tar and plaques out of asbestos for ideas surrounding right and wrong. 
  Right being, cis, heteronormative and capatalist- neo liberalist informing. Duh!
