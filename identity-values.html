    <p> An ethical decision I made recently was buying a powerade for a homeless presenting person, who accepted the powerade and offered me a seat next to them. 
      I believe it is an ethical decision to help those lesser than you, even when like me you are a student. 
      I politely declined their offer as I was walking Peggy, the Australian terrier, down to the water. It was a hot day and I felt good about giving them a cold drink. 
      On my return route, passing the corner bench with the concrete-square-box-tree, the plastic bottle an 1/8th of blue liquid glistening in the sun. I didn't cross the road, pick up the bottle and put it in the bin. 
      I don't think many people would, I mean covid world it's a bit different but still. I wonder what that says.

     <p>My heritage is Scottish, maternally, my mum's family moved over to Otepoti, Dunedin when she was a child. 
      My dad's family is Danish English, on his fathers side and French jewish, on my grannyâ€™s. I only have one remaining grandparent, so maybe separation is a big part of my identity. 
      I am at an age where looking into my family history and heritage, whakapapa is hard/ painful but also exciting and healing. 
      I come from a family of artists, my father is a musician and my mother is a theatre maker, my paternal grandad is an artist, my paternal grandmother was also a painter. My maternal grandpa was a regimental dance instructor in the army as well as a variety entertainer. My maternal granny, never had the opportunity to be an artist, she wqorked in a tobacco factory from age 12 and as a cleaner of Otago university, all her time in Aotearoa. 
      I believe that my artistic, working class heritage is a  informant of my identity and values. More than ever I want to break generational trauma and be in circles that my ancestors could have only dreamed of. </li>

      <p> Listening is a strength of mine that really helps me to understand what all this new information is. 
        During the sprints I have applied my listening practise. A learning limitation of mine would have been maintaining focus for long sustained time. 
        In saying that I do feel that I am combating that greatly, or more than I ever had before with pomodoro as a base for an 8 hour day. 
        I really want to master this over the coming weeks of foundations, knowing that I will be working for much longer periods of time. 
        It is only a limitation that I can prioritize and work towards. </p>

      <p> A colleague of mine and I had a misunderstanding when working on a theatre festival together. 
        It was just a complete misunderstanding of what was said, in passing / as well as body language, which resulted in us distancing ourselves from feeling not right, weird and a bit sad. 
        Not too much time passed, when we did come back together and have a genuine hug, as we were both comfortable and from there we were able to move on. 
        Although as the festival went on for a month after that there were still a few moments of tension that arose, across the season. 
        Next time, I would definitely take the time, at the time, to sit down and talk through what we were both thinking and feeling, so we could have resolved it fully and properly.
